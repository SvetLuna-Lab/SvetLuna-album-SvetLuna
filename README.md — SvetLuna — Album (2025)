## Project summary

This repository contains the *SvetLuna* album — a focused, small release of nine tracks exploring the intersection of algorithmic composition and human artistic choice. Each track began as an assistive generative sketch and was then arranged, shaped and finalized by the artist, Svetlana Romanova (artist credit: **SvetLuna-AI**).

The repository is intended as a professional release package for distribution, promotion and archival use.
